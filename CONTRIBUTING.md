# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to our projects! This document serves as a list of opportunities to get started.

## Open Source Projects

The biggest opportunity to contribute lies in our open source projects.

### Developer Skills Matrix

The Developer Skills Matrix is a self-assessment tool you can use to see where you are at in your development journey.

- [The skills matrix repository](https://github.com/Semalab/developer-skills-matrix) serves as the single source of truth - all of our integrations pull the matrix from this repo.
- [The discord bot](https://github.com/Semalab/developer-skills-matrix-discord-bot) is live in our server, and can be added to yours! It allows you to take the self-assessment quiz directly on Discord.
- [The slack bot](https://github.com/Semalab/developer-skills-matrix-slack-bot) allows you to take the self-assessment quiz directly on Slack.
- [The website](https://github.com/Semalab/developer-skills-matrix-website) allows you to take the self-assessment quiz on a website and download your results to your computer.

### Open Source Welcoming Committee

The OSWC curates a list of open source projects that are especially friendly and welcoming to new contributors.

- [The OSWC Query Bot](https://github.com/Semalab/oswc-query-bot) is a Discord bot that allows you to query the OWSC approved projects.
